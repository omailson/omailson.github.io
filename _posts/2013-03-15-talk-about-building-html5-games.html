Yesterday me and other two guys from <a href="http://www.indt.org/" target="_blank">INdT</a> (<a href="http://luisgabriel.me" target="_blank">lu√≠s gabriel</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/figueredo_" target="_blank">thiago figueredo</a>) gave a talk about HTML5 games development at the Federal University of Pernambuco (Brazil). The audience was really awesome and even though it only lasted two hours and most of them never wrote a single line of JavaScript code, they could achieve to bootstrap a simple HTML5 game.
