In a couple of weeks I'll be attending <a href="http://akademy2013.kde.org/" target="_blank">Akademy</a> for the first time. This is a KDE annual event and this year will take place in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilbao" target="_blank">Bilbao</a>.

I'm really excited (and nervous) about it because I'll give a talk about <a title="Okular summer of code" href="http://blog.mailson.org/2012/04/okular-summer-of-code/" target="_blank">my last year GSoC</a>, which I developed a tiled based engine for Okular. I didn't finish my presentation yet but I'll focus on how the tiles are managed inside Okular (the talk will be quite technical).

Of course, I'll publish my presentation here in my blog. But only after (or during) my talk. I just hate spoilers :)

I hope to see you there.
